Today, Amazon’s Kindle Store lists millions of ebook titles, a far cry from its initial catalog of 90,000 ebooks. It surpassed competitors such as Barnes & Nobles, making up 80% of ebook sales in the US. However, ebooks are unlikely to replace print, as a Pew Research Center study found that 65% out of 73% US adult readers read print books.<d-cite key ="perrin2016"></d-cite> But this same study also found that adults were more likely to read on tablets, phones, and computers.
