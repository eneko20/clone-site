Sample text here. This text will be put on the landing page of our site. Links will be added later for the rest of the pages.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Publishing has had a long and colored history, dating back to even before the advent of the printing press. 

This site was made as a report on that `history`, its ins and outs, and `how the Intenet affected` and `continues to affect` it.

> This site was made as a requirement in the completion of the course Internet Technologies and Web Development (MMS142) for the University of the Philippines Open University.

It is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with the [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), which was then customized by [members of Group M](https://mms142-groupm-2024.github.io/people/).
